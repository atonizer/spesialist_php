<h3>Why we are attending school?</h3>
<blockquote>
    <?php
    echo "Today: $wday, $month $day, $year";
    ?>
</blockquote>
<p>
    We have every moment that something is happening and full of life. Take lessons and noise changes, someone
    responsible at the board, someone desperately crams to control the material covered, someone put the "five" for
    the essay, someone blamed for unread book on the school playground children playing soccer, and girls -
    volleyball, some are preparing for a competition, others are involved in rehearsals holidays ... </p>
<h3>What is USE?</h3>
<p>
    USE stands for "Unified State Exam." Why is the "single"? CSE is both entrance exam and the final evaluation of
    each graduate school. In addition, the entire territory of Russia used the same type of tasks and single
    evaluation system. </p>
<p>
    Exam results are evaluated on a 100-point and five-point system and recorded in the certificate of the results
    of the unified state exam. The validity of this document expires on 31 December of the year following the year
    of issue, so students have the opportunity to enroll in college entrance exam with a certificate for two
    years. </p>
